# 🧠 Does Language Shape Our Reasoning?  
**A Critical Analysis of Rothschild's Theory on AI and Domain-General Reasoning**

This project explores the connection between language and thought, focusing on Rothschild’s argument that language plays a key role in enabling domain-general reasoning—particularly in the context of artificial intelligence (AI) development.

---

## 📌 Objective  
To examine the claim that language is not only a communication tool but also a **cognitive scaffold** for reasoning, especially in complex, domain-general problem-solving. This paper critically evaluates Rothschild’s theory and its implications for:
- Human cognition
- The development of LLMs and AI reasoning systems
- Language as a framework for rationality

## 🔍 Key Questions Addressed  
- To what extent does language shape reasoning and problem-solving?
- Is domain-general reasoning possible without language (in AI or humans)?
- How do current LLMs (like ChatGPT) reflect or challenge Rothschild’s claims?
- What are the implications for future cognitive models in AI?
